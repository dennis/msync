TODO:
	- Detect deleted files 
	- Detect new hardlinks (as hardlinks to old files will have the same
	  timestamp as the old file, msync will not detect them)
	- Use MD5 to skip existing files
	- If msync is interupted during operation, it may malfunction: 
		- As it ONLY uses mtime to detect changes, When synching files, it will
		  randomly transfer the files that needs transferring, which may result
		  in that it transfer a new file, then an old (etc). If the operation
		  is interrupted after the new file, the older ones will NEVER get
		  transferred.  Transfer files by age will eliminate this problem.
		- If files are only partially transferred, they'll never get resumed
		  unless the timestamp is incorrect (which is will be most of the time).
		  Transfer files to a temp file, then change permission/time and THEN
		  move it where it belongs
	- Multiple destinations: Not sure its worth the additional complexity
	- Re-think the master-slave protocol (ascii based? Smaller operations? Checksums)
	- Handle signals
	- Code-cleanup
	- Use sha1
	- man page
	- Support funky filenames (name containing /, spaces and alike)
	
	Needs thinking, but it would solve the two first items in the above list:
	- Make msync use a meta-directory to detect new fiels, deleted files..
