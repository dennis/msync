TODO
	- be smarter when meeting existing files. Use MD5 to skip files
	  that already have been transferred.
	- transfer older files before new (to be able to resume)
	- transfer files to a temp file, then move it - making it atomic
	- analyze directories to detect new files, deletes etc
	- tdiff implementation
