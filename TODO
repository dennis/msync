BUG
	- Currently you need to start msync with full path, otherwise the master
	  instance might not be able to start the slaves (it assumes that argv[0]) 
	  is enough to find it

TODO
	- be smarter when meeting existing files. Use MD5 to skip files
	  that already have been transferred.
	- transfer older files before new (to be able to resume)
	- transfer files to a temp file, then move it - making it atomic
	- analyze directories to detect new files, deletes etc
	- tdiff implementation
