WARNING:

	msync is built for er specific purpose. Don't use it unless you know the
	limitations of it (e.g. it ONLY uses timestamps to determine which file
	needs to be transferred, which can easily overlook new hardlinks to old
	files - as the new hardlinks will have the timestamp of the old file,
	and it does not detect deleted files at all). Keep rsync nearby :)

	However I hope to continue improving it until its robust enough to be
	a more generic tool
